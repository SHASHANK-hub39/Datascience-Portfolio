       1. Flight Fare Prediction : A Model to predict the flight fare of various airlines in different 
          conditions using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best fares for non-stop, 
          1-stop, 2-stops etc.. of various airlines that which a customer can select based on their 
          comfort utilizing machine learning.
       2. Car Price Prediction : A Model to predict the old car price based on it's condition using various 
          statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell the car utilizing 
          random forest algorithm in machine learning.
       3. IPL Score Prediction : Model to predict the score of a team by taking previous five overs data 
          as input using various feature engineering techniques.

       1. House Price Prediction : Neural network model which is used to predict the price of house. 
          Identified the best price that a customer can select based on the conditions utilizing 
          artificial neural network with pytorch.
       2. IRIS Plant Prediction : An Artificial neural network model capable of classifying an iris plant 
          based on four features. This is a multi class classification where each sample can belong to one 
          of three classes. 
       
   # CNN
   
       1. Handwritten Digit Recognition : Designing and implementing a convolutional neural network that 
          learns to recognize the handwritten digits from MNIST.
          
   # RNN
     
       1. Fake News Classification : An Long Short Term Memory model which is used to predict whether the
          news published is fake or not using word embedding technique.
          
          
  # Natural Language Processing
  
       1. Sentiment Analysis : A text based data with reviews taken from an amazon website and creating a model
          used to predict whether the review is positive or a negative.
          
       2. Fake News Classification : Model designed to predict whether the news published classifies a fake or not 
          using a Multinomial Navie Bayes Algorithm.
          
  # Feature Engineering
  
       1. Various feature engineering techniques like how to handle null data, categorical data, numerical data
          and types of ordinal encoding, nominal encoding also various techniques of handling outliers in dataset.

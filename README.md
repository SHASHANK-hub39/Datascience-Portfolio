       1. Flight Fare Prediction : A Model to predict the flight fare of various airlines in different 
          conditions using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best fares for non-stop, 
          1-stop, 2-stops etc.. of various airlines that which a customer can select based on their 
          comfort utilizing machine learning.
       2. Car Price Prediction : A Model to predict the old car price based on it's condition using various 
          statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell the car utilizing 
          random forest algorithm in machine learning.
       3. IPL Score Prediction : Model to predict the score of a team by taking previous five overs data 
          as input using various feature engineering techniques.

       1. House Price Prediction : Neural network model which is used to predict the price of house. 
          Identified the best price that a customer can select based on the conditions utilizing 
          artificial neural network with pytorch.
       2. IRIS Plant Prediction : An Artificial neural network model capable of classifying an iris plant 
          based on four features. This is a multi class classification where each sample can belong to one 
          of three classes. 
       
   # CNN
   
       1. Handwritten Digit Recognition : Designing and implementing a convolutional neural network that 
          learns to recognize the handwritten digits from MNIST.
          
   # RNN
     
       1. Fake News Classification : An Long Short Term Memory model which is used to predict whether the
          news published is fake or not using word embedding technique.
